# hello-world
A demo file to get a better understanding of github.
So far i've learnt frontend web development(html,css,javascript) and created some demo websites with the knowledge gained.
On the other hand i've learnt c programming language and currently learning c++ .
I hope that I could create something which makes me feel proud about myself.
